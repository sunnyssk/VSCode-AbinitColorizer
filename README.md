> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

{:.Basic Variables}This is the text.

## Requirements

Though not required by abinit itself, it is strongly recommended to comment after one blank character, if not the entire line.

This is because the output file includes several '#' which have no relation with comment at all.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something

## Known Issues

Calling out known issues can help limit users opening duplicate issues against your extension.

## Release Notes

Users appreciate release notes as you update your extension.

### 0.1.0

Initial release of Abinit Colorizer.

Provide with colorization of input, output and log files.
